# WWU CSCI301
CSCI301: Formal Languages and Functional Programming

* Introduction to discrete structures important to computer science, including sets, trees, functions, and relations. Proof techniques. Introduction to the formal language classes and their machines, including regular languages and finite automata, context free languages and pushdown automata. Turing machines and computability will be introduced. Programming using a functional language is required in the implementation of concepts. Includes lab.

Upon completion of this course, students will demonstrate:
* Thorough understanding of the mathematical definitions of concepts important to computer science, including sets, tuples, lists, strings, languages, graphs, trees, functions and relations
* The ability to prove basic theorems involving these mathematical concepts
* The ability to employ effectively the functional programming style in a functional programming language
* Solid understanding of fundamental classes of languages, including regular and context free, and their corresponding machines
* Basic understanding of Turing machines and computability
* Basic understanding of important algorithms, including conversion of finite automata to different forms, conversion of grammars to machines
* Basic understanding of LL(k) and LR(K) grammars and the parsing techniques used for those grammars
